        <h1 id="">Setup Page for the  "Remote Control Hub" Alexa skill</h1>

<h2 id="what-these-apps-do">What these apps do:</h2>
<p>This lets you link up many (likely most) of your RF- and IR-controlled devices to an Alexa Smart Home Skill.</p>
<p>This is limited to switches (on/off only, no dimmers or hi/medium/low).  It can also control scenes by setting up "devices" that correspond to multiple key presses on a remote. To simpify the setup, there is a special class for TV channels.  Just record devices named 0-9, and use the form below to set up your Channels.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-for-all-versions-of-the-code">What you need:</h2>

    <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U5IXFGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=seniorhacks20-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00U5IXFGI&amp;linkId=7ccfa57ddb7763778b2af1ffa3159dcf">Broadlink RM</a>.  That was an Amazon link, but also consider looking <a target="_blank" href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=9&pub=5575262058&toolid=10001&campid=5338021734&customid=&icep_uq=broadlink+rm+pro&icep_sellerId=&icep_ex_kw=&icep_sortBy=12&icep_catId=293&icep_minPrice=&icep_maxPrice=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229466&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg">at eBay</a><img style="text-decoration:none;border:0;padding:0;margin:0;" src="http://rover.ebay.com/roverimp/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=9&pub=5575262058&toolid=10001&campid=5338021734&customid=&uq=broadlink+rm+pro&mpt=[CACHEBUSTER]"> as the prices can vary a lot.  I purchased and tested this with the RM2 pro version. This should work with other models too, possibly with less functionality, but I don’t own one to test.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Android device on the same local network as the Broadlink. This could be a dedicated device (I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LCQNWNM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=seniorhacks20-20&amp;linkId=98ab0e13cc4bc9caa0bee166bcb8c05b">cheap android box</a>) or your phone, but this setup will only work while the Android device is on the same network as the Broadlink and is running the bridge app described under #3 (a battery drainer, so probably want a plugged in Android device). This may also work if the Android is on the local network via vpn, but I have not tested it. You can use this code to operate your devices from outside your network.   It is only the Android “bridge” device that must be on the same network as your Broadlink RM. IMPORTANT UPDATE September 2016: I was using an old Nexus 4 but choose something else.  Please research your device to see how it behaves if left plugged in for long periods.  Likely will work best with an Android TV box, a virtual machine on another computer, or similar setup without potential battery issues.  Search the web for “Nexus 4 battery bulging” to see the very bad phone self-destruction that happened due to leaving it plugged in and running for this app.  Everything else here works fine and any old cheap android box should work if this baattery issue is avoided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Android app called (called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.fun2code.android.rmbridge&amp;hl=en">RM Bridge</a>), used to “bridge” between the Broadlink and web-based services like Alexa. This is needed because Broadlink does not publish information that would allow users to directly interface with it.  Other developers have figured out a way around this, so I am not attempting to reinvent it.</p>   
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A physical remote control for whatever you want to control here.  If you’ve lost it, you will need to program it into a universal remote.  There is no way to access a list of manufacturer codes with the Broadlink.</p>
  </li>
    <li><p>An externally accessible IP address.  Many easy to use external and free services make this easy.  Search for "dynamic DNS serves," and follow the service's setup instructions.  One popular free service (no recommendation commission to me) is no-ip.com</li>
    <li><p>A port on your router forwarded to the port used by the RM Bridge app.  Instructions for doing this vary by router, but are readily available online.</li>

<h2 id="">Save your IP address to your Google Drive:</h2>
<form action="https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyDzfOCO2MDFh9sSeHtexkiLmR6idiEHSrfxxqRAWZE5L8duBg/exec" method="post">

<h2 id="">Create TV channel Map on your Google Drive:</h2>
<p>Eventually to be automated, but for now go to your Google Drive, and in a folder called "Broadlink Controller" create a Google spreadsheet called "channels."  In it, include nothing but a list where column 1 is the spoken channel name and column 2 it its number.  Each row can have one channel.  You can grab a demo to edit and save in your own drive from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qJW4ISGmm_pfHdFJ5XX-W1j8lWOMWfRPearL1jE-jvU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
