# My Alexa Skills and Related Projects

I am working on a number of other skills for Alexa, that I will host for developers on GitHub, in addition to eventual skill publication if possible. Right now there are two skills in progress, so you can subscribe to "announcements" on the forum page to find out when they are released. Click the links below for an overview of what each one will be, and feel free to make development suggestions in the forum here, or via the Github page for the project. I also have a finished project that interfaces with Alexa, but is not a skill.

Coming Soon: <a href='https://beckyricha.github.io/alexa-text-messenger/'>Alexa Text Messenger Skill</a> - An email to text gateway. Will not read and send from your phone number. I may also make a variant that can send and receive from Android phones that incorporates IFTTT (no page for that project yet).

Coming Soon: <a href='alexa-notifications'>Custom Notifications</a> - Users set up any sort of notifications they want via IFTTT, and send then to Google Drive. This skill will manage and read them as a custom notification feed. 

<a href='https://beckyricha.github.io/alexa-gmail/'>"My Email"</a> A <a href='https://www.amazon.com/R-Onuschak-my-email/dp/B01NAK87B2'>published Amazon Echo skill</a>, also hosted on GitHub for those who wish to modify it for hteir own use.

<a href='https://beckyricha.github.io/Broadlink-RM-SmartThings-Alexa/'>Broadlink for Alexa</a> - Existing completed project, but not an Alexa skill. Uses SmartThings and an inexpensive hub device to link Alexa to your existing remote controlled devices (total project cost ~$35 - $50, plus intermediate IT skills).

<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Onuschak-Federal-Government-Operating-Status/dp/B01N6L13BT'> Federal Government Status</a> This is a simple published Alexa Skill to provide DC area federal governmenet operating status.  Checks two different ways to help wuth occasional OPM web site issues.  The code is not on GitHub but contact me for info if you want it for some reason.
